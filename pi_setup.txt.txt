I broke the initial setup that came with the card, so I downloaded a new image to my 64GB micro SD. After it booted,
I ran 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade'. Then after seemingly running around like a chicken with her 
head cut off, I found this website [https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-phpmyadmin/] and followed it and both steps 
to set up a web server and install mysql. The root password for MYSQL is the same as the password I set for the pi.
